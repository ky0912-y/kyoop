<li>EARTH</li>
<br><text="gold">
Earth has only one moon, which we call “the moon”. It is the largest and brightest object in the night sky, and the only solar system body besides Earth that humans have visited in our space exploration efforts.
<br></text>

<li>MARS</li>
<br><text="gold">
Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.Phobos is the larger of Mars' two moons. It orbits Mars three times a day. Deimos is the smaller moon. It orbits Mars every 30 hours.</text></br>

<li>JUPITER</li>
<br><text="gold">
<center>Europa</center>
Structure. Like our planet, Europa is thought to have an iron core, a rocky mantle, and an ocean of salty water. Unlike Earth, however, Europa's ocean lies below a shell of ice probably 10 to 15 miles (15 to 25 kilometers) thick, and has an estimated depth of 40 to 100 miles (60 to 150 kilometers).

<center>Lo</center>
<br>
Jupiter's rocky moon Io is the most volcanically active world in the solar system, with hundreds of volcanoes, some erupting lava fountains dozens of miles (or kilometers) high.
</br>
<li>saturn</li>
<center>Titan</center>
<br>
This mammoth moon is the only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere, and it's the only world besides Earth that has standing bodies of liquid, including rivers, lakes and seas, on its surface. Like Earth, Titan's atmosphere is primarily nitrogen, plus a small amount of methane.

<li>URANUS</li>
<text="gold"><center>Oberon</center>
<br>
Oberon is the second largest moon of Uranus. Discovered in 1787, little was known about this moon until Voyager 2 passed it during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Oberon is heavily cratered―similar to Umbriel―especially when compared to three other moons of Uranus: Ariel, Titania and Miranda. Like all of Uranus' large moons, Oberon is composed of roughly half ice and half rock. Oberon has at least one large mountain that rises about 6 km off the surface.

<li>URANUS</li>
<text="gold"><center>Triton</center>
<br>
 Triton is the largest of Neptune's 13 moons. It is unusual because it is the only large moon in our solar system that orbits in the opposite direction of its planet's rotation―a retrograde orbit. Scientists think Triton is a Kuiper Belt Object captured by Neptune's gravity millions of years ago.
