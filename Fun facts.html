<ul>
<li>Sunsets on Mars are blue.<li>

NASA said this is because "dust in the Martian atmosphere has fine particles that permit blue light to penetrate the atmosphere more efficiently than longer-wavelength colors" like yellow, orange, and red.

<li>The Apollo astronauts' footprints on the moon could last up to 100 million years.</li>

Moon rocks erode at a rate of 0.04 inches every 1 million years. This means that the astronauts' footprints on the moon from the Apollo mission in 1969 could be there for 10 to 100 million years.


<li>Space isn't always cold. In fact, it can get pretty hot.</li>

In the darkest parts of space, temperatures can reach -454 degrees Fahrenheit. But if you're orbiting near Earth in the sunlight, space is a toasty 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Astronauts' spacesuits are white to reflect the heat they encounter while floating above the Earth.

<li>A year on Venus is shorter than a day there.</li>

Venus spins very slowly in the opposite direction of Earth â€” 243 Earth days for a full rotation. But it only takes 225 days to go around the sun because it's so close to it. Therefore, a year on Venus is shorter than a day.

<li>The International Space Station (ISS) is the size of a football field.</li>

The International Space Station is 357 feet long, just three feet less than an American football field. It weighs 925,000 pounds and is the largest single human-made structure to ever enter space.
