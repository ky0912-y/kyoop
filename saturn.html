Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second-largest planet in the solar system. It has a whopping 145 moons. 
It's the farthest planet from Earth that's visible to the unaided eye, but the planet's most outstanding features — its rings — are better viewed through a telescope. 
Although the other gas giants in the solar system — Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune —  also have rings, Saturn's rings are particularly prominent, earning it the nickname the "Ringed Planet."
