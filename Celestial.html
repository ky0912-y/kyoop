<Li>DWARF PLANETS</li>
<br>
Because of the sheer size of these bodies, we have not found a small division of our galaxy. There are a few mnemonics helpers accessible to recall the names of the planets in our nearby planetary group. Dwarf planets are one of them. Our solar system additionally contains a dwarf planet named Pluto. It used to be one of the planets. However, because of certain complexities now it falls under the classification of dwarf planets.

<li>INSTRINSIC VARIABLE STARS</li>
<br>
The variability in the stars is because of changes in the physical properties. Intrinsic variable stars are divided into three subgroups.
</br>
<ol>
<li>Pulsating variables are the stars whose radius expands and contracts alternately. This activity is like a part of their natural evolutionary ageing processes.</li>
<li>Eruptive variables are the stars who experience eruptions on their surfaces like flares or mass ejections.</li>
<li>Cataclysmic or explosive variables are the stars that undergo a cataclysmic change in their properties like novae and supernovae.</li>
</ol>
<li>THE ASTROID BELT</li>
<br>
Within the main asteroid belt, scattered in orbits around the sun are bits and pieces of rock left over from the dawn of the solar system. Most of these objects, called planetoids or asteroids — meaning "star-like" — orbit between Mars and Jupiter in a grouping known as the main asteroid belt.
The main asteroid belt lies more than two-and-a-half times as far as Earth does from the sun and contains millions of asteroids.
